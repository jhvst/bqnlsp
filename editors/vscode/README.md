# BQN LSP for vscode

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run compile`
- Open VSCode, select `out/extension.js`, go to "Run & Debug", debug as Visual Studio Code extension
- Another copy of VSCode should open that's using the LSP. If you get documentation when hovering over a symbol, it is working as expected.
